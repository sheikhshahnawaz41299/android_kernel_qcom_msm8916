ALPS HSCDTD007A 3-axis magnetic sensor

The ALPS 3-axis magnetic sensor is a complete 3-axis magnetic sensor with
on-chip signal processing and intergrated i2c bus. It can be connected to host
processor via i2c. It can measure magnetic fields within the full scale range
from -16 Gauss to +16 Gauss.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "alps,hscdtd007a".
 - reg			: i2c address of the device.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power up the device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - hscdtd,layout	: The layout of the ecompass sensor chip.

 Example:
	A chip on 8916 platform with the pattern as the above graph:
	&i2c_0 { /* BLSP1 QUP2 */
			alps@c { /* Magnetic field sensor */
				compatible = "alps,hscdtd007a";
				reg = <0x0c>;
				vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
				vio-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
				hscdtd,layout = <0x0>;
			};
	};
